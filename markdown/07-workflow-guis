# Workflow GUIs
Since every module in bionode is a Stream, bionode can with minimal wrapping be integrated into JavaScript workflow GUIs. NoFlo and Nodered are two example, and there's some bionode experimental and hacked code around those.

## Workflow GUI with native Streams support
However, ideally we don't want to wrap bionode Stream into another framework module, so some people are working on GUIs with native Streams support.

## "Brainstorms/proof-of-concept" on formats for workflow graph representation:

Bionode and Dat devs have also been discussing what would be the best simple text file format to represent these pipelines.
